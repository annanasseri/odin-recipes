<h4>Description</h4>
<p>I think of Kuku Sabzi as the Persian's festive, herby, and flavor-packed take on frittata or omelet. Kuku Sabzi is a traditional Persian omelet typically served at Nowruz (Persian New Year) --the herbs symbolizing rebirth, and the eggs symbolizing fertility.This kuku sabzi recipe is one heck of a solution to those fresh herbs wilting in your fridge. And you can certainly throw in other greens like baby spinach.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>2 cups flat-leaf parsley, leaves</li>
<li>2 cups cilantro, leaves and tender stems</li>
<li>1 cup roughly chopped fresh dill</li>
<li>6 scallions, trimmed and coarsely chopped</li>
<li>1 ½ tsp baking powder</li>
<li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
<li>¼ tsp ground black pepper</li>
<li>6 large eggs</li>
<li>½ cup walnuts, toasted and chopped (optional)</li>
<li>⅓ cup dried cranberries, coarsely chopped (optional)</li>

</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
<li>Coat the bottom and sides of the pan with 2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, turning the parchment to coat on both sides (the oil should pool at the bottom and generously coat the sides).</li>
<li>In a food processor, combine the parsley, cilantro, dill, scallions and the remaining 3 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil. Process until finely ground </li>
<li>In a large bowl, whisk the baking powder, salt, cinnamon, cumin and pepper. Add 2 eggs and whisk until blended, then add the remaining eggs and whisk until just combined. Fold in the herb-scallion mixture and the walnuts and cranberries, if using. Pour into the prepared pan and smooth the top.</li>
<li>Bake in 375 degrees F heated-oven until the center of the egg is firm, about 20 to 25 minutes. </li>
<li>et the kuku cool in the pan undisturbed for 10 minutes. When ready, run a thin knife around the edges to loosen the kuku. Invert onto a plate and remove the parchment from bottom, then re-invert on another serving plate or a cutting board so the top of the kuku is facing you. Slice into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
<li>Serve with a dollop of yogurt!</li>
